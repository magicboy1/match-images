Create a polished Arabic "matching pairs" memory game screen for kids.

Fix the following problems from the previous version:
- The cards were too small and centered with a lot of empty space.
- The text "0/2 أزواج" overlapped with the cards.
- All cards showed only a question mark, so the concept of image pairs was not clear.
- The layout did not use the full screen width.

New requirements:

1) Layout
- Use a full-width game board centered vertically.
- For Level 1, display a 2x2 grid of big square cards.
- Each card should be at least 200–250px on a full HD screen so kids can easily tap them.
- Reduce empty space on the sides; the cards should feel big and clear.
- Keep a clean top bar with:
  - Left: rounded "إعادة" button.
  - Center: badge showing the level, e.g. "المستوى 1".
  - Right: title in Arabic "لعبة تطابق الصور".
- Move the pairs counter below the level badge (not overlapping the cards), e.g. "0 / 2 أزواج".

2) Game logic
- Use REAL image pairs instead of just question marks.
- Each pair should be two related images, for example:
  - Scientist 👨‍🔬 with a microscope 🔬
  - Robot 🤖 with a gear ⚙️
  - Lock 🔒 with a key 🗝️
  - Shield 🛡 with lock 🔐
- Initially all cards are face-down and show a soft question mark icon.
- When a card is tapped, flip it with a smooth animation to reveal the image.
- After the child taps a second card:
  - If the two images form a correct pair, keep them revealed with a green glow and play a success sound.
  - If not, briefly show both, then flip them back face-down.

3) Levels
- Level 1: 2 pairs (2x2 grid).
- Level 2: 4 pairs (2x4 grid).
- Level 3: 6 pairs (3x4 grid).
- After completing all pairs in a level, show a centered modal:
  - Title: "أحسنت! اكتشفت كل الأزواج 🎉"
  - Buttons: "المستوى التالي" and "إعادة اللعب".

4) Visual style
- Use the same color theme as the existing project: green background, yellow cards, playful kids style.
- Cards should have soft shadows, rounded corners, and a subtle glow on hover/tap.
- Text must be in Arabic, right-to-left:
  - "لعبة تطابق الصور"
  - "المستوى 1"
  - "إعادة"
  - "أزواج"
- Make sure the pairs counter and progress bar are clearly visible and not overlapping the cards.

5) Technical
- Implement as a single React component suitable for a Vite app.
- Store card data (images and pair relations) in a simple array so we can replace icons later.
- Support touch events (tap) and mouse clicks.
